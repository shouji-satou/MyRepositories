# Dispatch a GitHub Actions Workflow
This template uses the `github:actions:dispatch` action which dispatches a given GitHub workflow with 2 inputs. A maximum of 10 inputs could be sent to the GitHub Action as configured in the workflow file. A GitHub token is required to run this workflow.

A sample workflow has been included [here](sample-workflow.yml) for testing purposes.
